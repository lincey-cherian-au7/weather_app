Hello, My Friends Thank you for having interest in this repository !

To use this application,

Type " npm install " inside the root directory ( Download Server Dependencies )
Type " npm start " to run this application.

I have used openweathermap API (https://openweathermap.org/) for getting the data and https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons for getting the icons.
